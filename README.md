# 🌱 SoilSense – Soil Moisture Prediction using Machine Learning

**SoilSense** is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts soil moisture levels using environmental data like temperature, humidity, and rainfall. This project helps farmers and agricultural researchers monitor soil conditions and make informed irrigation decisions — **without using expensive physical sensors**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Predict soil moisture percentage from real-world environmental parameters  
- 🧠 Trained using popular ML models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest  
- 📈 Visualization support for comparing predictions and actual data  
- 🌐 Clean and responsive user interface  
- 🌾 Easily extendable to IoT systems and smart farming dashboards  

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript / Streamlit (optional)
- **Backend / ML**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Share or Flask (optional)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. 📥 **Collect data**: Temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil type  
2. 🧹 **Preprocess dataset** using Pandas & Scikit-Learn  
3. 🏗️ **Train & validate models** like Random Forest, Linear Regression  
4. 🧮 **Build a prediction function** that accepts user input  
5. 🌐 **Integrate into a web interface** for real-time usage

## 📊 Sample Input Format

| Temperature (°C) | Humidity (%) | Rainfall (mm) | Soil Type |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| 28               | 70           | 2              | Sandy      |
| 32               | 50           | 0              | Loamy      |

## ✅ Output

- **Predicted Soil Moisture**: `31.2%`
- Graphs comparing actual vs predicted moisture (if dataset provided)
- Actionable insights for irrigation scheduling

---
## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- Add support for real-time IoT sensor input  
- Integrate Deep Learning models for improved prediction accuracy  
- Deploy as a mobile-first web application  
- Connect with smart irrigation systems and agricultural dashboards
